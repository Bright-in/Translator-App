# Production
This app was made to help students at the North West University understand other languages. 
The university currently supports 3 languages and so does the app, the languages are English, Afrikaans, and Setswana.
The app will take any of the 3 languages and translate it into any of the other languages supported.
This is to help students who maybe can not understand slides or work posted on efundi, which is the universities learning tool in another language.

# Approach
I first went and made a google form to find out how many students would apprecaite an app that would translate the study materials into their home language.
I then used the results to conclude that the app will help a lot of students in reading school work in their home language.
Coding the app wasn't easy because I had to find libraries that would work with the languages suported.
Once the app was final I presented it to the class and gave it out to some friends of mine to try it out.
The feedback from everyone is what I'll use to improve the app even further.
The goal is to add even more South African languages to the app as time goes on.
